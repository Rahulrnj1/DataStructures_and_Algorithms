/*
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Input Format:
First and only argument of input contains an integer array A

Output Format:
return a single integer denoting single element

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 2 000 000  
0 <= A[i] <= INT_MAX

Examples :

Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output 1:
3
Explanation:
3 occurs only once

Input 2:
A = [1, 2, 2]
Output 2:
1
