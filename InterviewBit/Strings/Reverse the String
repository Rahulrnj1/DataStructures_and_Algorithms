/*
Given a string A. Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

Input Format
The only argument given is string A.

Output Format
Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

Example

Input 1:
    A = "the sky is blue"
Output 1:
    "blue is sky the"

Input 2:
    A = "this is ib"
Output 2:
    "ib is this"
