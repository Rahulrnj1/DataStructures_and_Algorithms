/*
Given a singly linked list and an integer K, reverses the nodes of the
list K at a time and returns modified linked list.
NOTE : The length of the list is divisible by K 

Example :
Given linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 and K=2,
You should return 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5

Try to solve the problem using constant extra space.
