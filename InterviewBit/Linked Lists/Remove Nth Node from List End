/*
Given a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of list and return its head.

For example,
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

 Note:
If n is greater than the size of the list, remove the first node of the list.
Try doing it using constant additional space.
